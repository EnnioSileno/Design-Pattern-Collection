# Singleton Pattern

The __Singleton Design Pattern__ should be used when a class must have a single instance. It disables all means of creatingobjects of a class except for the special static creation method.

Now follows a short description of the created examples:
 - SimpleSingleton -> the simplest implementation
 - SingletonThreadSafeV1 -> Easy thread safe approach
 - SingletonThreadSafeV3 -> Improved Version over V1
 - SingletonThreadSafePerformance -> Even more improved version of V1 and V3
