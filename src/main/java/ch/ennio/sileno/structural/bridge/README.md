# Bridge Pattern

Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies - abstraction and implementation - which can be developed independently of each other. This way you can independently introduce new abstractions and implementations; making it very easy to switch between them at runtime.
